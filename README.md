# Analysis performed
* Create a list of all countries to which orders have been shipped.

    * How many orders have been placed in total?

    * How many orders have been shipped to each country?

* For each product, list its product ID, product name, and the company name.

    * Which 5 countries have the heaviest shipments, on average?

    * Which 10 companies have placed the most orders? List the contact name of each company.

* Sort the customers by total amount spent on orders in descending order.

* Sort customers with a total spending greater than 20,000 in descending order.

* Sort the employees by the number of orders they sold in descending order.

    * How many employees account for about half of the orders? (You do not have to use SQL to answer this question. A rough estimate is sufficient.)

* List customers who have never placed an order.

* List the products with the highest level of discount in descending order.
